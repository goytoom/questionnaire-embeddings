This data was collected through an interactive on-line version of the Generic Conspiracist Beliefs Scale in 2016.
See Brotherton, Robert, Christopher C. French, and Alan D. Pickering. "Measuring belief in conspiracy theories: the generic conspiracist beliefs scale." Frontiers in psychology 4 (2013). 
Visitors completed the test primarily for personal amusement.
At the end of the test but before the results were displayed, users were asked if they would be willing to complete an additional survey and allow their responses to be saved for research. Only users who agreed yes are in this dataset. Individuals with age < 13 were not recorded.

The responses to the GCBS are in (question numbers match to items in TABLE A1 of Brotherton, et. al. 2013.):

Q1 - Q15

The time spent answering each question was also recorded, and are stored in variables

E1 - E15

The other following time elapses were also recorded:

introelapse		The time spent on the introduction/landing page (in seconds)
testelapse		The time spent on the GCBS questions
surveyelapse	The time spent answering the rest of the demographic and survey questions

The Ten Item Personality Inventory was administered (see Gosling, S. D., Rentfrow, P. J., & Swann, W. B., Jr. (2003). A Very Brief Measure of the Big Five Personality Domains. Journal of Research in Personality, 37, 504-528.):

TIPI1	Extraverted, enthusiastic.
TIPI2	Critical, quarrelsome.
TIPI3	Dependable, self-disciplined.
TIPI4	Anxious, easily upset.
TIPI5	Open to new experiences, complex.
TIPI6	Reserved, quiet.
TIPI7	Sympathetic, warm.
TIPI8	Disorganized, careless.
TIPI9	Calm, emotionally stable.
TIPI10	Conventional, uncreative.

The TIPI items were rated "I see myself as:" _____ such that

1 = Disagree strongly
2 = Disagree moderately
3 = Disagree a little
4 = Neither agree nor disagree
5 = Agree a little
6 = Agree moderately
7 = Agree strongly



The following items were presented as a check-list and subjects were instructed "In the grid below, check all the words whose definitions you are sure you know":

VCL1	boat
VCL2	incoherent
VCL3	pallid
VCL4	robot
VCL5	audible
VCL6	cuivocal

VCL11	pastiche
VCL12	verdid
VCL13	abysmal
VCL14	lucid
VCL15	betray
VCL16	funny

A value of 1 is checked, 0 means unchecked. The words at VCL6, VCL9, and VCL12 are not real words and can be used as a validity check.
